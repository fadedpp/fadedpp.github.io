                <h1> Transferable Skills</h1>
                <h3 class="skillscss">Time-Management</h3>
                <h4>I have developed Time-Management Skills through volunteering at the Ymca. This is because I work in the weight floor and balancing various tasks such as assisting multiple gym-goers, managing equipment, and maintaining cleanliness requires good time management skills.</h4>
                
                <h3 class="skillscssleadership">Leadership</h3>
                <h4>Taking initiative in organizing equipment, leading small group sessions, or helping out new volunteers is a highlight of good leadership which I posses and act with. I also motivate new gym goers letting them know that going to the gym consistently is not an easy task and they should be proud of doing hard work.</h4>
                <h3 class="skillscss">Attention to Detail</h3>
                <h4>Ensuring equipment is properly sanitized, checking for safety hazards, and maintaining a tidy workout area reflect your attention to detail and commitment to quality. I also have gone through training that enhances this even more because there is training for child abuse which inorder to do it properly, you need to have good attention skills</h4>
                <h3 class="skillscss">Communication</h3>
                <h4> Effectively communicating exercise techniques, safety guidelines, and fitness advice to new gym goers or even someone doing a excercise wrong which could lead them to getting an injury demonstrates my ability to communicate clearly and professionally. I also have to communicate to my mentor if I can't go due to school or other reasons.</h4>
                <h3 class="skillscsssigma">Customer Service Skills</h3>
                <h4> Interacting with gym members, assisting them with equipment, and answering questions further enhances my customer service skills. I also assist new members with machines and show them around the gym and if they need me to clean anyhting or help them I assist them and give them adequate customer service.</h4>
                <h3 class="skillscss">Teamwork</h3>
                <h4> Collaborating with other volunteers, fitness trainers, or YMCA staff to ensure a smooth operation of the weight floor demonstrates my ability of teamwork and collaboration skills. To elaborate further, Most of the time when you volunteer you are paired with another volunteer. If we communicate with each other and set out different parts of the gym we can clean, we reduce each others work and we can get done faster.

                </h4>
                <h3 class="skillscss">Adaptability</h3>
                <h4>Responding to different fitness levels and goals of gym members and adjusting your approach accordingly demonstrates my adaptability and flexibility. This is because I have friends in the gym that are there and using my knowledge I have to help them based on each of there body types.This isn't really a part of my job but I always do this in a gym environment inorder to help people and mainly my friends out.</h4>
                <h3 class="skillscss"> Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
                <h4>Addressing member concerns, troubleshooting equipment issues, and adapting workouts to individual needs showcases  my problem-solving abilities. There have been multiple times where I have had to use my problem-solving skills. For example if a member comes up to me asking why the gym machine isn't working I have to look at the cables and see if everything is fine. If it isn't and I can't fix it I call my mentor and we come up with a plan to fix the issue. </h4>

                    <h3>What are the 3 most important lessons we covered?</h3>
                    <p>I feel like resiliency, time management and the wellness thing we did are the most important lessons. Resiliency is improtant everywhere in life because you can't let vulnerabiltiy get to you otherwise you will struggle in life. Time management is needed everywhere in life and no matter what angle you look from, it is present everywhre in everyones lives. Welllness is needed for b asic function and if you don't have you bodys essential wellness figured out how are you going to perform at your best?</p>
                    <h3>Describe 3 areas / lessons that you need growth in. Why and How are you going to do it?</h3>
                    <p>I feel like time management, stress management, and Smart Goals are the areas I need to improve on. These all corellate with each other and I have shown poor demonstration of these areas in the past. I plan to start doing assignments the second I Get them and start doing healthy practices to keep my mind calm and set up goals in that calm and stress free mind.</p>
                    <h3>In our mid course reflection of future ready skills you reflected on mastery of these skills. How have you improved and How will you furthur improve in grade 11?</h3>
                    <p> I have improved on taking responsibility of my actions such as talking with mr eggink of a over due assignment and also being more consistent with handing in assignments unlike the beginning of the year. Self regulation is also something I have worked on because I decided to stop goofing around in class as much and focus mroe on my work which was evident in the personal choices and carer choice section of CALM 20. For self regulation in grade 11 I will be more mindful of my environment and choosing whether I should be sitting in a environment that is loud or quiet. I will also improve on responsibility by being more responsible of my work and who I sit around with.</p>
